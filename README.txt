Welcome to Richr! Grant an unimaginable fortune to anyone you want and see what they do with! In order to play this game, download as ZIP
and extract by right clicking. Then, run RichrManager.py.

If you want to add characters, make sure you meet all criteria for a character. If I like your character I'll pull it in 
and make it a part of the base game. This is ONLY if you want to create a full character, with a wish and name.

You can also add descriptions to a list of descriptions that could appear in the game randomly.

 If you want to see a name, you can add it to the list of names.
